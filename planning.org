#+TITLE: Planning

* Scoping

** APIs

   Google Books API: https://developers.google.com/books/
   relevant API doc: https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using

   Allows for searching by title, author and provides links for thumbnails.

   Example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      curl -X GET 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=intitle:flowers+inauthor:keyes'
   #+END_SRC

* TODO list

** Bigger things  
*** TODO Remove poc package
*** TODO Add test framework to sbt
*** TODO Add docker build (with docker-compose)
*** TODO Integrate with GH Actions
*** TODO db backend
*** TODO Import Goodreads shelves
*** TODO Import Calbire collections (what are they called??)

** Smaller Things
*** TODO Log when decoding fails (ie with title: hi, author: there)
*** TODO Sort out logging middleware
*** TODO Add scalafix (for imports, etc)

* Emacs Client

** Transient

   Main menu:
   - *Search*"
     With variables matching the google search keywords
   - *My shelves*

** Book List buffer

   Style should be similar to ~steam.el~, with thumbnails follow by meta
   information (can we use org in some kind of ro mode for this?). Key input
   would be replaced by commands operating on the book section the cursor is
   currently on. For example, ~a~ lists books by the current author, ~s~ saves
   the book to a given shelf.
